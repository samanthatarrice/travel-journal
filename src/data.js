      description: "Visiting Patagonia in Argentina was an amazing trip. We were about a mile away from hiking all the way up Monte Fitz Roy, the mountains you see on the Patagonia company logo. But, we decided not because the conditions were icey and I was five months pregnant. We did see glaciers up close, and I've never been more freezing in my life. A few times we could see ice melting off, which was exciting, but seeing how far the glaciers had receeded was a real eye opener."

      description: "To get to Boipeba you have to first, get to Salvador, Bahia. Then, you take a ferry to a town across the bay. From there you find a taxi to drive you to a town an hour away. Then, you have to wait for a speedboat to drive you an hour down the coast. The trip is more than worth it though. I've never experienced such a remote beach getaway like this!"
